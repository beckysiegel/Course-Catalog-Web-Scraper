Course-Catalog-Web-Scraper
==========================

This is a python script that uses the beautiful soup library that gets courses each term and adds them to a MySQL database.

This was part of a larger calendaring project that determines when people are free/busy, and instructors are busy while they are teaching classes. The other components of this project included getting information from the google calendar API, and then using this data to determine when people are free.
